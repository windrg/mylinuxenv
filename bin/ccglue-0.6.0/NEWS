Introducing the ccglue_tracer utility that can dump call-tree 
output to the terminal. Allows usage outside Vim and possible
reprocessing of call-trees to other applications.

June 9, 2012 Hari Rangarajan (harirangar@sourceforge.users.net)
The tracer functionality has been expanded to include the location
of the symbol (i.e., filename, linenumber)
Internal changes include
* Using Ben Hanson's lexerTL C++ library to parse the cscope database
    - Parsing now happens with a memory mapped file if the OS has support
* Using the FSB allocator to speedup data structure maintenance 
(missing support for unordered_tree, adding it creates a double-free, 
 look at it later)
