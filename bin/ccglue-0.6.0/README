ccglue is intended to be the interfacing app between cscope and ctags. It
can generate cross-reference tag files that can be interfaced with the Vim
CCTree plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2368). There
is a stand-alone command-line tracer (ccglue_tracer) that can dump 
call-tree outlines whose output can be reprocessed.

Currently supported languages: C

Some babble:
Cscope and ctags are semantic analysis tools that excel in specific areas,
i.e., ctags has excellent tag support for a huge number of languages, while
cscope's flex scanner provides excellent semantic analysis.  However, what is
left lacking is usually context for the semantic analysis. Context allows you
to generate more data that can be used for more purposes, i.e., case in hand
call-graph, code completion, and error detection. This tool attempts to analyze
the cscope generated data using additional context from ctags data. 

More features and language support to follow.

ctags -- ctags.sourceforge.net


BUILDING and INSTALLING
****************************************
The package with configured with auto-tools.  The typical installation process
should work on most systems. Requires a reasonably recent C++ compiler with
STL libraries (including TR1).

	./configure
	make
	make install

Options to the configure script are up to you.  For details, run:

	./configure --help
(There is only a debug flag to generate debug symbols)


USAGE
*****************************************

Build cross-reference tag file with index

    $ ccglue -I                                     (or --build-index)

Trace symbols

    $ ccglue_tracer -s SYMBOL_NAME -c f -d 2        (f - forward tree, r - reverse)
